      The house smelled like <span class="fillslot">pumpkin</span> and <span class="fillslot">cinnamon</span> as the kids
      walk across the <span class="fillslot">dark</span> hall. The house seems to be empty but still they can't help
      feeling like <span class="fillslot">someone is watching them</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look! That door is open!" <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> points to a door <span
        class="fillslot">behind George</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could <span class="fillslot">George's dog</span> could have gone there? Maybe they already returned outside...", <span
        class="fillslot">Jack</span> whispers their voice trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No they definitely are here", says <span class="fillslot">George</span> who has reached the open door first. "I
      can
      see their footsteps in the dust. And they are only going one way...", <span class="fillslot">Jack</span> gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others gather next to them and look down narrow stairway that must go in to the basement of the house.
      However,
      all they can see in the end of the stairs is complete darkness...
    </p>
    <p>
      But then they hear <span class="fillslot">howls</span> from <span class="fillslot">around the room</span>. They are <span
        class="fillslot">surrounded by spooky scary ghosts</span>!
