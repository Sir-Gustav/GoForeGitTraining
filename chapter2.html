    <div class="story-area">
      <p>
        When <span class="fillslot">George</span> got back with their <span class="fillslot">dog</span>, <span
          class="fillslot">Jack</span> and <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> had already <span class="fillslot">dressed up</span>. While
        <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> was standing in front of the mirror adjusting their <span
          class="fillslot">wigs</span>, <span class="fillslot">Jack</span> was sitting on the hallway floor wondering
        whether the <span class="fillslot">makeup was scary enough</span> or whether they should ask their mum
        for
        an extra <span class="fillslot">makeup</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh finally!" <span class="fillslot">Jack</span> sighed when <span class="fillslot">George</span>, dressed as <span
          class="fillslot">dracula</span>, opened the front door. "What took you so long?" <span
          class="fillslot">Tim</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">Buying an outfit for a dog</span> took longer than I thought", <span class="fillslot">George</span>
        moaned in frustration holding <span class="fillslot">dog</span> dressed as <span class="fillslot">bat</span>. "How was <span class="fillslot">dinner</span>? Did you <span class="fillslot">eat</span> while I was gone?" <span class="fillslot">George</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">Yes</span>. But <span class="fillslot">you don't have time to eat now</span>! Otherwise we'll get apples or something when people run out of candy", <span
          class="fillslot">Jack</span> snapped, stood up and straightened their <span class="fillslot">vampire</span> costume.
        "Come on, let's go!"
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">5</span> minutes later...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">Oh no</span>. Our neighbors were already almost out of candy!", <span
          class="fillslot">Jack</span> huffs and shoots an angry look at <span class="fillslot">George</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We could go to <span class="fillslot">Kansas street</span>", <span class="fillslot">George</span> proposes. "They
        are quite a few houses there and most kids don't go there."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah because <span class="fillslot">it is too scary</span>!", <span class="fillslot">Tim and Jack</span> states worried look on their face.
        They won't admit it to their friends but they are actually a little bit afraid of <span
          class="fillslot">one of the house</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's the big deal? You're not afraid of the <span class="fillslot">old lady that lives in that house</span>, are you?", <span class="fillslot">George</span> smirks.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course I'm not!" <span class="fillslot">Tim</span> scoffs but looks still nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well let's just go then! Let's get that candy!" <span class="fillslot">George</span> says sounding <span
          class="fillslot">demanding</span>. They start leading the group towards <span class="fillslot">Kansas street</span>. <span
          class="fillslot">Tim</span> hesitates for <span class="fillslot">a bit</span> and then sprints after the
        others.
